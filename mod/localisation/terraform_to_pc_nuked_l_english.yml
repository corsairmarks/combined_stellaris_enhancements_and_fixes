 tech_pc_nuked_terraform_desc: "Allows access to the \"PLANETVIEW_TERRAFORMING\" tab before it would otherwise be available but does not enable any specific form of terraforming. This technology is intended to unlock the tab for empires whose main species is at home on Tomb Worlds and thus qualify to use $pc_nuked$ \"$PLANETVIEW_TERRAFORMING$\" without $tech_terrestrial_sculpting$ and $tech_tomb_world_adaption$."
