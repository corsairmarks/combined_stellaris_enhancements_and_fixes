 distar.171.desc.robotic.volunteer: "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has concluded [Root.Leader.GetHisHer] study on the neural symbionts found on [From.From.GetName]. These slug-shaped creatures consist mostly of a complex brain in a resistant protein casing. Despite their neurological advancement, their lack of external organs and limited motor capacities make any attempts at communication exceedingly difficult. After weeks of frustration, [Root.GetLeaderName] experimented with introducing the creatures into an animal host. The reptilians these neural symbionts once built a primitive society with on [From.From.GetName] are too aggressive to facilitate experimentation, so a number of substitute species from the surface were tested instead.\n\nRegrettably, the symbionts refused to attach themselves to any of the offered animals. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] hypothesizes that the symbionts will only accept a certain kind of host - perhaps, importantly, a willing one.\n\nIn order to get at the heart of this mystery, a willing sapient, organic host could be offered to the neural slug. [Root.GetLeaderName] regrets that [Root.Leader.GetSubjectPronoun] cannot volunteer due to [Root.Leader.GetPossPronoun] purely mechanical physiology. [brainslug_scientist.GetName] has volunteered to offer [brainslug_scientist.GetReflexivePronoun] as the host in place of [Root.GetLeaderName]. After all, if these symbionts were capable of turning wild animals into tool-using farmers, what might they do for us?"

 leader_species_traits.7.desc: "As per our agreement with the neural symbionts we have come to call "brain slugs," only willing hosts are joined with them. Few change their minds after rejecting a symbiont, but [brainslugged_leader.GetTitle] [brainslugged_leader.GetName] recently resolved to host a neural symbiont. After the initiation ceremony and subsequent medical observation, [brainslugged_leader.GetSubjectPronoun] [brainslugged_leader.GetHasHave] returned to service. [brainslugged_leader.GetPossPronounCap] connection to the symbionts' collective consciousness will undoubtably improve [brainslugged_leader.GetPossPronoun] performance."
