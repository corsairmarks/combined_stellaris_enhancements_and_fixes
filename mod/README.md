# Overview

This mod is a compilation of most of my other fixes and balance mods.  Please see the description of each individual mod for what the effects are.

Individual mods update first, then changes are merged here.

# Major Update

Versions 4.0.0 and above are fully updated for Stellaris version 3.2 "Herbert" which introduced breaking script syntax changes and thus this mod is not backwards compatible with earlier versions of Stellaris.  You can manually download the most recent version of this mod without breaking change here: [3.3.4](https://github.com/corsairmarks/combined_stellaris_enhancements_and_fixes/releases/tag/3.3.4).

You only need the contents of the `mod` folder for a local install, disregard the other directories and files. You should rename the folder and then copy the entire (renamed) folder into the local `mod` folder.  More instructions on where to install local mods can be found on the [wiki](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Mods).

# Bundled Mods

This is a bundle of mods to resolve compatibility issues if you want to use them all together.  Please check each individual mod for the effects and any known issues.  The large hex strings are the commit hashes - that is mostly for my own record-keeping to know what revision of the other source code is contained here.

## Source Code

Hosted on [Github](https://github.com/corsairmarks/combined_stellaris_enhancements_and_fixes)

### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.

## Methodology

Each of the source repositories above is added as a remote to this repository on my local machine.  I fetch all the repositories, then merge them into the `master` branch of this repository.

1. `git remote add <friendly-remote-name> <repo-url>`
2. `git fetch --all -n` to get all the commits, but not the tags
3. `git checkout master` (stash if you need to beforehand)
4. `git merge --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories -m "merge version 1.2.3 from another repo" <friendly-remote-name>/<branch or commit hash>` (`--allow-unrelated-histories` is only required the first time an unrelated tree, i.e. new remote repo, is added - the first merge commit establishes history between the trees)
5. Solve merge conflicts, if any
6. `git merge --continue`

# Compatibility

Requires Stellaris version 3.2.2 "Herbert" and disables achievements.

Check each of the contained mods for an explicit list of incompatibility notes.  Generally, this mod is incompatible with other mods that change worker jobs or built-in special event jobs, districts, or the Full Military Service species right.

## Recommended Companion Mods

The standard planet view has a very small graphic representing your planet's environment and its sky, and so sometimes it is hard to see the alternate sky backgrounds.  This is particularly true for the temperate planets: tropical, continental, and ocean.  To solve that, I _**highly**_ recommend you use [Planetary Diversity - Planet View](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1866576239) to expand the viewport.  As a graphics-only mod, it can be added or removed at any time.  It is also stand-alone, so it is not required to use the rest of [Planetary Diversity](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819148835).

## When to Install

This mod should not be removed from your save game.  Some added modifiers and technologies will not work without the changes in this mod.  You can add it safely to already-started games but you will miss out on some of the game-start-time changes (such as the updated version of the Extensive Moon System modifier applying to all moons around a gas giant with the modifier).
