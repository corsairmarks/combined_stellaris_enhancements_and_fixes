# Overview

Tired of your city-planets not being top-tier trading hubs? Then this mod is for you! This mod adds an "Ecumenopolis Commercial" colony designation that boosts the build-speed of commerical buildings and residential arcologies by 25% and overall trade value by 20%.  That is the same boost as Urban Worlds, Trade Stations, and Commercial Ring Worlds.

# Changes

Adds the `col_ecu_trade` colony type.

## Compatibility

Practically any mod, as long as it doesn't entirely remove ecumenopoleis or create the same colony type.

## Changelog

* 1.0.0 Initial version

## Source Code

Hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/corsairmarks/ecumenopolis_trade)

### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.
