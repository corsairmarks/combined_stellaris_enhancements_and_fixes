# Overview

This mod is a compilation of most of my other fixes and balance mods.  Please see the description of each individual mod for what the effects are.

Individual mods update first, then changes are merged here.

# Bundled Mods

This is a bundle of mods to resolve compatibility issues if you want to use them all together.  Please check each individual mod for the effects and any known issues.  The large hex strings are the commit hashes - that is mostly for my own record-keeping to know what revision of the other source code is contained here.

# Compatibility

Requires Stellaris 3.0.3 and disables achievements.

Check each of the contained mods for an explicit list of incompatibility notes.  Generally, this mod is incampatible with other mods that chnage worker jobs or built-in special event jobs, the Full Military Service species right, (most) society technologies, or changes to the Prosperity tradition.

## Post-Game Start

This mod should not be removed from your save game.  Some added modifiers and technologies will not work without the changes in this mod.  You can add it safely to already-started games but you will miss out on some of the game-start-time changes (such as Ringworld preference for Driven Assimilators/Rogue Servitors with Shattered Ring, or the updated version of the Extensive Moon System modifier applying to all moons around a gas giant with the modifier).
