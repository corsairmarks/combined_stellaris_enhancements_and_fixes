# Space Fauna Multiple Resolutions Fix

Are you tired of not being able to protect the Space Amoebas and the Tiyanki at the same time?  Then this mod is for you!

# Changes and Compatibility

This mod replaces the `resolution_categories\00_resolution_categories.txt` file that defines most of the Galactic Community
resolutions categories.  The only change is to add the tag `multiple_active_resolutions = yes` to the Space Fauna category.

Because it replaces a core Stellaris file, this mod is inherently incompatible with any other mods that overwrite the same file.
If another mod only changes resolution categories for the Galactic Custodian/Galactic Imperium then it might be compatible with this one -
those live in a different file.  If another mod only changes the resolutions themselves, it should be compatible with this one.

This mod is not compatible with achievements because it overwrites a core Stellaris file.
