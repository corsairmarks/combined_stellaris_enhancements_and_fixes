[h1]Overview[/h1]
Do you wish your Trade Stations and Commercial Ring Worlds had a little more "oomph?"  Or maybe you're disappointed with how far ahead Ecumenopolis Commercial Worlds got with my mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2597129991]Colony Designation: Ecumenopolis Commercial[/url].  Then this mod is for you!  The Trade Station and Commercial Ring World colony designations now also boost the build-speed of commercial buildings and the relevant commercial districts by 25% as well as the  overall trade value by 20%.  That is the boost as the Ecumenopolis Commercial designation.

Additionally, Trade Districts and Commercial Segments now provide more Merchant jobs and fewer Clerk jobs as long as the colony designation is Trade Station or Commercial Ring World respectively.  But wait, there's more!  Empires with the Merchant Guilds civic will find that more Merchants replace Clerks.  But wait, there's [i]even[/i] more!  Megacorps replace some Clerks with an Executive(s) and Manager(s).  And if that wasn't enough, we'll throw in positive interaction with the "Commercial Enterprise" tradition for another/more Merchant(s) and the "Interstellar Franchising" tradition for another/more Clerk(s) or Manager(s).

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Overwrites the Trade Station and Commercial Ring World colony designations and the Trade District (for both habitats and the special district for Origin: Shattered Ring) and Commercial Segment district.  The colony designations enable some job swaps from Clerks to Merchants (extra swaps with the "Commercial Enterprise" tradition).  The designations also provide a small amount of bonus trade if you meet varying hidden, trade-related conditions - see if you can figure them out.  The districts themselves also swap jobs if the owner has Civic: Merchant Guilds, Civic: Corporate Dominion (for people who don't own Megacorp), and Megacorps.

Also updates the regular City districts to provide part of a Merchant or Executive job for Trade Guilds, Corporate Dominions, or Megacorps as appropriate when combined with the "Commercial Enterprise" tradition.  Ringworld city segments no longer receive bonus clerks from the "Interstellar Franchising" tradition - instead, those clerk jobs are provided by the commercial segments.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Overwrites the  [b]col_city[/b],  [b]col_habitat_trade[/b], and  [b]col_ring_trade[/b] colony types and existing trade-related districts:  [b]district_city[/b],  [b]district_srw_commercial[/b],  [b]district_hab_commercial[/b],  [b]district_rw_city[/b], and  [b]district_rw_commercial[/b].  Despite vastly improved compatibility via Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra," this mod remains separate from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2597129991]Colony Designation: Ecumenopolis Commercial[/url] because viewing Commercial Arcologies now requires a UI mod, and this mod does not.

This mod will not work well with other mods that make changes to the same colony designations or districts.  Overhaul mods commonly make changes to districts, but are more likely to overwrite the entire file.  Due to how Stellaris file-loading works, change from this mod will overwrite code from full-file district overwrites and apply the verion of commercial districts from this mod.  That's good for thi mod, but could interfere with other modifications bade by other mods.

Compatible with Planetary Diversity.

Built for Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra."  Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]Recommended Companion Mods[/h3]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2597129991]Colony Designation: Ecumenopolis Commercial[/url] to add a trade-focused colony designation and district to ecumenopolis worlds.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be safely added to your savegame after the game has started.  Because it adds gameplay objects, it should not be removed during a game.

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
Overwriting a colony type or district produces an error log.  Expect to see eight entries in error.log similar to these:
