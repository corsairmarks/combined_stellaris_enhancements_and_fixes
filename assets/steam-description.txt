[h1]Overview[/h1]

Have you ever noticed that some habitable planet classes, when they are moons, will display the parent planet in the sky in the planet view (with rings, if it has them)?  Do you wish that all habitable moons had this feature instead of just a few?  This mod is for you.

The artwork is already present in [i]common/gfx/portraits/environments[/i], it just isn't enabled for all planet classes which have art.  These planet classes already use the fancy sky art:

[list]
[*]Arid ([i]pc_arid[/i])
[*]Savannah ([i]pc_savannah[/i])
[*]Arctic ([i]pc_arctic[/i])
[*]Alpine ([i]pc_alpine[/i])
[*]Ecumenopolis ([i]pc_city[/i])
[/list]

Note that Tomb Worlds ([i]pc_nuked[/i]) do not have fancy sky art available.

[h2]Notes[/h2]

There are probably lots of other mods that make this same change, but I made this one with the express purpose of merging it in to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2522974089]Subtle Polish[/url].

[h1]Changes[/h1]

No gameplay changes.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

This mod replaces several default planet classes, where the only change is to set [b]uses_alternative_skies_for_moons = yes[/b].

[list]
[*]Desert ([i]pc_desert[/i])
[*]Tropical ([i]pc_tropical[/i])
[*]Continental ([i]pc_continental[/i])
[*]Ocean ([i]pc_ocean[/i])
[*]Tundra ([i]pc_tundra[/i])
[*]Gaia ([i]pc_gaia[/i])
[/list]

What this means to you is that this mod is incompatible with other mods that make changes to the above six (6) planet classes.

Fully compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819148835]Planetary Diversity[/url] because that mod does not overwrite the built-in planetary classes.

[b]Not[/b] compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=937289339]Real Space[/url], but that mod already activates the same art so you don't need this one.

[b]Not[/b] compatible with achievements. Why? Planet classes are a gameplay object, even though the ultimate effect of this mod is cosmetic only.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]

This mod can be safely added or removed from your savegame at any time.

[h3]Recommended Companion Mods[/h3]

The standard planet view has a very small graphic representing your planet's environment and its sky, and so sometimes it is hard to see the alternate sky backgrounds.  This is paricularly true for the temperate planets: tropical, continental, and ocean.  To solve that, I [i][b]highly[/b][/i] recommend you use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1866576239]Planetary Diversity - Planet View[/url] to expand the viewport.  As a graphics-only mod, it can be added or removed at any time.  It is also stand-alone, so it is not required to use the rest of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819148835]Planetary Diversity[/url].
