[h1]Overview[/h1]

This mod is a compilation of most of my other fixes and balance mods. Please see the description of each individual mod for what the effects are.

Individual mods update first, then changes are merged here.

[h1]Major Update[/h1]

Version 2.0.0 adds a mod that reduces compatibility of this mod. Because Deassimilate Machines can be incompatible with other assimilation mods, this may cause issues if you are already using such a mod. You can manually download the most recent version without this breaking change here: [url=https://github.com/corsairmarks/combined_stellaris_enhancements_and_fixes/releases/tag/1.3.4]1.3.4[/url]. You only need the contents of the [b]mod[/b] folder for a local install, disregard the other directories and files. You should rename the folder and then copy the entire (renamed) folder into the local [b]mod[/b] folder. More instructions on where to install local mods can be found on the [url=https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Mods]wiki[/url].

[h1]Bundled Mods[/h1]

This is a bundle of mods to resolve compatibility issues if you want to use them all together. Please check each individual mod for the effects and any known issues. The large hex strings are the commit hashes - that is mostly for my own record-keeping to know what revision of the other source code is contained here.

[h2]Source Code[/h2]

Hosted on [url=https://github.com/corsairmarks/combined_stellaris_enhancements_and_fixes]Github[/url]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

Requires Stellaris 3.0.3 and disables achievements.

Check each of the contained mods for an explicit list of incompatibility notes. Generally, this mod is incompatible with other mods that change worker jobs or built-in special event jobs, districts, the Full Military Service species right, (most) society technologies, or changes to the Prosperity tradition.

[h2]Recommended Companion Mods[/h2]

The standard planet view has a very small graphic representing your planet's environment and its sky, and so sometimes it is hard to see the alternate sky backgrounds. This is particularly true for the temperate planets: tropical, continental, and ocean. To solve that, I [i][b]highly[/b][/i] recommend you use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1866576239]Planetary Diversity - Planet View[/url] to expand the viewport. As a graphics-only mod, it can be added or removed at any time. It is also stand-alone, so it is not required to use the rest of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819148835]Planetary Diversity[/url].

[h2]When to Install[/h2]

This mod should not be removed from your save game. Some added modifiers and technologies will not work without the changes in this mod. You can add it safely to already-started games but you will miss out on some of the game-start-time changes (such as Ringworld preference for Driven Assimilators/Rogue Servitors with Shattered Ring, or the updated version of the Extensive Moon System modifier applying to all moons around a gas giant with the modifier).
