[h1]Overview[/h1]
Ever been disappointed at all the wasted Pops when you conquer or integrate a Machine Intelligence? This mod is for you! Now you can de-assimilate the Machine Units into Robots once you have discovered the Positronic AI technology.

This mod also features an enhancement for machine empires - robot Pops also gain bonus trait picks and points from the machine-boosting relevant technologies and traditions. Thus robot Pops will be just as useful as machine Pops to machine empires.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Adds the "Machine Dissociation" assimilation living standard for Machine Unit Pops. Coupled with an override of the "Assimilation" citizenship, this enables you to convert machines into robots as a regular, non-gestalt empire (as long as you have Positronic AI).

An event window will display when you have Positronic AI and communications with a Machine Intelligence to tell you that machine deassimilation is available.

Overrides the robomodding series of technologies for machine empires (Machine Template System, Binary Motivators, and Nanite Assemblers), the Synthetic Age tradition, and the Solid State Actuators tradition to grant both machine and robot trait picks/points.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Built for Stellaris version 3.7 "Canis Minor." Not compatible with achievements.

This mod has to alter a number of built-in game objects to implement its gameplay. Here's a list of of what is overridden and why:
[list]
[*]Effect [b]assimilation_effect[/b] - main assimilation logic (called by [b]action.65[/b]), altered so that deassimilated machines are not converted into the synthetic species for fully synthetic empires, also code de-duped
[*]Citizenship [b]citizenship_assimilation[/b] - Assimilation, altered to allow machines to be deassimilated by non-gestalt empires
[*]Species Population Control [b]population_control_yes[/b] - deassimilating machines must have population controls
[*]Species Population Control [b]population_control_no[/b] - deassimilating machines are not allowed to reproduce
[*]Species Colonization Control [b]colonization_control_yes[/b] - deassimilating machines must have colonization controls
[*]Species Colonization Control [b]colonization_control_no[/b] - deassimilating machines are not allowed to colonize
[*]Technology [b]tech_robomodding_m[/b] - Machine Template System in order to grant machine empires trait points to both machines and robots
[*]Technology [b]tech_binary_motivators[/b] - Binary Motivators in order to grant machine empires trait points to both machines and robots
[*]Technology [b]tech_nanite_assemblers[/b] - Nanite Assemblers in order to grant machine empires trait points to both machines and robots
[*]Tradition [b]tr_synthetics_synthetic_age[/b] - Synthetic Age in order to grant machine empires trait picks for both machines and robots
[*]Tradition [b]tr_synthetics_solid_state_actuators[/b] - Solid State Actuators in order to grant machine empires trait points for both machines and robots
[/list]
What this means to you is that this mod is not compatible with most other assimilation-altering mods. That is because its highly likely they are editing the same events and species rights.

This mod is explicitly compatible with all of my other mods, including those that also modify assimilation or other species rights.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be safely added to your savegame after the game has started. It is implemented through events, effects, and species rights that alter game rules without adding object definitions. If you remove it, you will keep any machine Pops that have already been converted to robots, but any remaining machine Pops will probably revert to their default "disconnected machine" purge policy. Stellaris is fairly forgiving in situations like this - it's likely that error logs would be generated and the game would otherwise ignore the missing content. Back up your savegame before trying to remove a mod.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
This mod overwrites several core Stellaris game objects. Expect to see eleven errors in your error.log similar to these. All are necessary to implement the functionality of this mod.
