[h1]Overview[/h1]
Celebrate your empire's culture again by constructing Leisure Districts on habitats and Leisure Arcologies on ecumenopoleis! Habitat Leisure Districts once again provide 2 Entertainer jobs and a Culture Worker job and ecumenopolis Leisure Arcologies once again provide 3 Entertainer jobs and 3 Culture Worker jobs. With the introduction of ethic-specific Culture Worker bonuses in Stellaris version 3.5 "Fornax," the job again has a unique identity beyond "society researcher."

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Leisure Districts on habitats again provide +2 Entertainer jobs and +1 Culture Worker job and Leisure Arcologies on ecumenopoleis provide +3 Entertainer jobs and +3 Culture Worker jobs.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
