[h1]Overview[/h1]
Have you ever wondered what happened to the former leaders of your subject after you integrated them? Or perhaps where that pre-FTL leader went after you annexed their planet? Wonder no more! With this mod you will be prompted to choose what to do with the now-unemployed leaders whenever you integrate a subject, conquer a pre-FTL planet, "allow" pre-FTLs to join you via covert infiltration, or convert then via a colossus weapon.

Demoted rulers you acquire through integration/conquest/etc. will (in most cases) preserve their existing ruler traits in case they somehow become the ruler of your empire. Rulers demoted for any reason such as being integrated or even losing an election benefit by gaining the same former ruler traits. They may not have won the hearts and minds of voters, but they still rose to the occasion and developed new skills. This will applies when being demoted from ruler for any reason, such as gameplay from another mod.

Regular (non-machine and non-hive) empires can retain leaders from an integrated Machine Intelligence subject if they have full AI rights. The leaders in a Machine Intelligence have enough capacity to act as independent agents, even if the rest of the Pops don't.

Scientists and Admirals are automatically assigned back to their per-integration roles, if they were commanding a science ship or fleet. Notably, if you play with "pause-on-event" the science vessels will then continue their assigned orders after the leader is reassigned for command.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
A lot of code has gone into figuring out what leaders you can choose to keep based on what kind of country you are playing, what ethics it has, what kinds of assimilation or necrophage might be available. All of that boils down to an event screen that appears when you have integrated a subject or conquered a pre-FTL planet, or a second event when you have infiltrated a pre-FTL planet.

These event present you with a few choices about what you can do with the leaders from the now-defunct subject/pre-FTLs. It will show a few different options depending on what is available to you. For example, genocidal empires can only keep leaders that are of their own species and necrophage empires have the option to necrophage leaders. There's a special secret bonus for some kinds of leaders - see if you can figure out what it is.

This mod was designed to be played with the default restrictions on ascension paths - mainly that your empire would normally not have more than one assimilation type available to it. However, it is coded in such a way that if you have multiple assimilation types available, any of the "assimilate" button options invokes the same follow-up code. Each integrated leader (and their species) in a regular (non-machine, non-hive empires) are assigned the first assimilation type that they qualify for in this order: synthetic, then cybernetic, then psionic, then deassimilation. If you are using my machine deassimilation mod, that type is checked first (before synthetic assimilation).

Finally, this mod adds some special traits (and a special name affix) for demoted former rulers and heirs. Their names will be followed by brown text indicating that they are the "Former Ruler/Heir of the <Country Name>" and they will gain a special trait depending on their former empire and new leadership role.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Built for Stellaris version 3.8 "Gemini." Not compatible with achievements.

This mod is designed to understand the species types, ethics, civics, authorities, governments, and origins that are built-in to Stellaris. The features of this mod are implemented primarily through brand new events and scripting, meaning that it should not directly conflict with most other mods. However, you could end up with odd behavior if you play with mods that significantly alter the default gameplay - for example, adding a new homicidal species (without the mod providing an update to the [b]is_homicidal[/b] trigger). Mods that add or modify civics should generally work but this mod may offer decisions that do not make the most sense for the role-play of new civics.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be safely added to your savegame after the game has started. If you remove it, you will lose access to the custom "former ruler/heir" traits and the espionage bonus that is one of the choices upon successfully infiltrating pre-FTLs. Stellaris is fairly forgiving in situations like this - it's likely that error logs would be generated and the game would otherwise ignore the missing content. Back up your savegame before trying to remove a mod.

[h3]Required Dependency Mods[/h3]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2499031295]Leader Traits: All Eligible Species Traits[/url] ensures your leaders get all their species-based traits when being assimilated (such as Cybernetic, Psionic, or Erudite).

[h3]Recommended Companion Mods[/h3]
[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553812372]Deassimilate Machines[/url] allows non-hive, non-machine empires to "deassimilate" machine Pops into robots - specifically allows (with this mod) for machine deassimilation as a "leadership disposition" choice for integrated subjects (etc.) and the deassimilated leaders gain synth leader traits if you have the required technology
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2908463208]Assimilate All the Pops[/url] allows empires to have multiple assimilation types, which enables this mod to apply all unlocked assimilation types simultaneously to your retained leaders
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2488154830]Pre-FTL Conquest & Infiltration: Enhanced[/url] improves the pre-existing infrastructure when you conquer or otherwise acquire a planet that had previously been pre-FTL; pairs well with this mod's bonus leaders from conquered (etc.) pre-FTLs

[/list]
You might wonder - why are these separate mods? They override default gameplay options, so I thought it best to give players the choice on whether they want the original version or the reimagined version. Machine Deassimilation was developed alongside this mod.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
[h3]Stellaris Bugs[/h3]
Demoted rulers with very long names with a period may cause error logs when the Leader screen is open. Don't leave the Leader window open for long periods of time or you will generate a very large error log file.
