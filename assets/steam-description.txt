[h1]Overview[/h1]

Tired of your city-planets not being top-tier trading hubs? Then this mod is for you! This mod adds an "Ecumenopolis Commercial" colony designation that boosts the build-speed of commerical buildings and residential arcologies by 25% and overall trade value by 20%.  That is the same boost as Urban Worlds, Trade Stations, and Commercial Ring Worlds.

[h1]Changes[/h1]

Adds the [b]col_ecu_trade[/b] colony type.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

Practically any mod, as long as it doesn't entirely remove ecumenopoleis or create the same colony type.
