[h1]Overview[/h1]
Have you ever wondered why Resort Colonies are perfectly useful on Tomb Worlds but not Penal Colonies?  Or been frustrated at needing to use a high-habitability planet as your Penal Colony?  Then this mod is for you!  The modifier for Penal Colonies is altered to grant 100% habitability, but imposes a flat -50% to Pop growth speed (the same as 0% habitability).  In exchange for the overall growth penalty, you gain a new bonus to immigration-based Pop growth, a bonus to inmate job output, and (implicitly) reduced upkeep due to high habitability.  Finally - your prison-planet has a large penalty to research - the criminals cannot be trusted with state research secrets and have limited ability to communicate off-planet.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Adds a new pop stratum "Inmate" that is automatically assigned to most Pops on a Penal Colony.  This new stratum acts similarly to slave - Pops demote instantly, they have +10% productive job output, and they have a significant happiness penalty (-25%).  In addition they have a -90% penalty to research point output to represent the lack of off-world communication as well as tight control of any information they do receive.  Inmates have very little political power and their unhappiness won't significantly impact the happiness of non-Inmate Pops on the planet (ruler-strata Pops, enforcers, telepaths, and soldiers - the Inmates can't be trusted to supervise [i]themselves[/i]).  Should you also have the Police State civic, each Inmate produces bonus Unity.  Regardless, Inmates generate crime - which is doubled when unemployed.

The Penal Colony planet designation has been altered to +1 Criminal job per 10 Pops - some of the convicts in the planet-wide prison system manage to escape supervision.  To compensate, Penal Colonies gain bonus stability that scales compared to how [i]unhappy[/i] Inmate Pops are.

The Penal Colony planet modifier (added when you enact the Create Penal Colony decision) has been slightly altered as well - it grants +100% habitability (just like Resort Worlds) and +33% Pop Growth from immigration, but now also imposes a flat -50% to overall Pop Growth.  Your other planets also receive a small amount of flat crime reduction (-5) in addition to the existing -25% crime bonus.

To keep your Penal Colony running smoothly, this mod also creates a new capitol building complete with recolored icons.  Some Politician jobs are replaced with the new Warden job that produces unity and stability, but also decreases the happiness of Inmate-stratum Pops.  Countries with other Politician-substitution civics end up replacing all of the Politician jobs with a split of Wardens and their special ruler jobs.  If your empire uses Battle Thralls, they can also serve as Wardens.

Finally, you can use your inmates to your military advantage.  Penal colonies are automatically defended by Penal Conscript Garrisons instead of standard Defense Armies, and you can conscript (train) more to serve in assault Penal Conscript Legions.  Penal Conscripts (both types) have double the health of their corresponding standard army types, but deal increased collateral damage and have lower moral.  Penal Conscript Legions are limited to one per Pop with the Inmate stratum (the maximum count updates monthly).

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
This mod replaces three game objects related to Penal Colonies:
[list]
[*]decision_penal_colony - decision to enact a Penal Colony
[*]col_penal - Penal Colony designation
[*]penal_colony - static modifier for Penal Colonies
[*]penal_colony_other_planets - static modifier that decreases crime on other planets
[/list]
And it overrides three scripted triggers related to capitol buildings:
[list]
[*]has_upgraded_capital
[*]has_major_upgraded_capital
[*]has_fully_upgraded_capital
[/list]
This mod is incompatible with other mods that want to also overwrite these same game objects.  It works with other mods that alter built-in buildings or jobs - the new capitol building is implemented without any building file overwrites.  If other mods also attempt to change the script for checking whether advanced buildings are allowed to be constructed, a compatibility patch should be straightforward.

Built for Stellaris version 3.3 "Libra."  Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be safely added to your savegame after the game has started, but not removed.  Because this mod adds buildings and a job, removing it could result in problems when the game cannot find an expected building definition or finds Pops assigned to a job that no longer exists.  Back up your savegame before trying to remove a mod.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
Overriding a colony designation or a decision causes the game to log an error, so expect to see two lines in the error.log file similar to:
