 ai_assistant_upgrader.4.title: "Scientist AI Assistants Upgraded"
 ai_assistant_upgrader.4.desc: "Recent advances in §H$tech_sapient_ai$§! paved the way for more effective AI research assistants. Scientists using a §H$leader_trait_custom_AI_assistant$§! have been able to upgrade it to a much more effective §H$leader_trait_sapient_AI_assistant$§!. If any scientists were too busy to perform the upgrade themselves, assigning them to a new role will ensure the research logistics bureau is able to upgrade their assistant before their new assignment begins."
 ai_assistant_upgrader.4.a.tooltip: "Every scientist:\n- Removed the §H$leader_trait_custom_AI_assistant$§! trait\n- Gained the §H$leader_trait_sapient_AI_assistant$§! trait"
